Formatting API requests:
#Endpoints #Path Parameters #query parameters


This is a Get request sent from Frontend, and Response request sent from server back to Frontend:
    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.render("index.ejs");
    });
    app.post("/submit", (req, res) => {
    const numLetters = req.body["fName"].length + req.body["lName"].length;
    res.render("index.ejs", {numberOfLetters: numLetters});
    });

I can call it private API.
If i want my srver to talk to someone else's server and back 
(get some data, interact with that server) - it will be also in Request and Response, but this time it's done
via a public API.
